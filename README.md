## 1. Overview the project :  
It's about rewriting an old game : Boulder Dash (1984) created by Peter Liepa and Chris Gray. 

The goal of the game is to collect diamonds to activate the exit and win. To do this, the player must dig his way and be careful of obstacles like monsters or rocks.

## 2. Installation
To install our project, it will be necessary to restore some access paths : 
* The "Showboard" library in the packages "view", "entity" and "contract"
* The "MySQL Connector" library in the package "main".
* The Sprite Folder in entity.sprite.class line 68.
* The Map.txt in model.DAOmap.class line 13.
* The Map.txt inmain.main.class line 33.


## 3. The Team
The team is composed of Anthony Lorendeaux, Laetitia Kessas and Arthur Caldeireiro.

For the design of diagrams we worked together.

For the code, Anthony was in charge of the controller part, Laetitia was in charge of the model part, and Arthur was in charge of the view part.

Arthur was the manager on this project.
